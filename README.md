# Sudoku-Project

This project is a simple Sudoku game written in C++. The game has three difficulty levels: easy, medium, and hard. The user can choose a difficulty level at the start of the game.

The game is played on a 9x9 grid. The user can enter numbers in the empty squares. The numbers must be unique in each row, column, and 3x3 square. The user can also use the q key to give up and see the solved puzzle.

The game uses the backtracking algorithm to solve the puzzle. The backtracking algorithm is a recursive algorithm that tries all possible combinations of numbers until it finds a solution.

The game is written in C++ and uses the following libraries:

* iostream
* stdlib.h
* cstdbool
* string
The game is a simple project that can be used to learn the basics of C++ programming. It can also be used to learn the backtracking algorithm.
